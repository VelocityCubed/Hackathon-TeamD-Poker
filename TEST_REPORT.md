# Poker Game Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-10-24

## Test Methodology
Tested the poker game systematically using Playwright MCP to interact with the browser and verify functionality across different scenarios.

## Issues Found

### ‚ùå Issue #1: Game Phases Skip Incorrectly
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** When a player clicks "Check" during the preflop phase, the game skips directly to the river phase showing all 5 community cards at once, instead of progressing through the proper sequence: Flop (3 cards) ‚Üí Turn (4 cards) ‚Üí River (5 cards).

**Expected Behavior:** 
- Preflop ‚Üí Flop (3 cards)
- Flop ‚Üí Turn (4 cards)  
- Turn ‚Üí River (5 cards)

**Actual Behavior:**
- Preflop ‚Üí River (5 cards immediately)

### ‚ùå Issue #2: Raise Amount Input Field Always Disabled
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** The raise amount input field (`<input id="raise-amount">`) is always disabled, preventing players from customizing their raise amount. Players can only raise by the default value (20 chips).

**Expected Behavior:** 
- Players should be able to click on the raise input field and change the amount
- The field should be enabled when it's the player's turn

**Actual Behavior:**
- The input field is always disabled (grayed out)
- Players cannot interact with it to change the raise amount
- Raising always uses the default 20 chips (or last value set programmatically)

**Workaround:** The raise amount can be changed programmatically via JavaScript, and the Raise button will use that value, but users cannot change it through the UI.

### ‚ùå Issue #3: Chip Counts Not Updated Correctly After Fold
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** When a player folds, the chip counts and bet amounts displayed on the main game screen are not updated correctly. The player's chips should be reduced by the amount they bet before folding, but they remain at the previous value.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Player bets 20 chips and has 1040 chips remaining
- Player folds
- Player's chip count should remain at 1020 (already deducted the bet)
- Player's "Bet" should show 0
- Bot wins and chip count increases by pot amount

**Actual Behavior:**
- Player shows "Chips: 1040, Bet: 20" even after folding
- Winner modal correctly shows bot won the pot
- Visual state doesn't match the game state

### ‚ùå Issue #4: Reset Game Button Not Working
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Clicking the "üîÑ Reset Game" button does not reset the game. The button appears to be active (highlights when clicked) but nothing happens.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Click "Reset Game" button
- Game container becomes hidden
- "Start New Game" button appears
- Both players' chips reset to 1000
- Game state is completely reset

**Actual Behavior:**
- Button can be clicked
- Nothing changes on the screen
- Game remains in the same state
